### ❗ Build Request: .jar file for Minecraft Mod

Hello!  
This mod displays the world seed on the F3 debug screen.  
Could anyone kindly help build the `.jar` from this template?

- Minecraft version: 1.21.5
- Mod loader: Fabric
- Java: JDK 17 required
- Build command: `./gradlew build`

After building, the `.jar` file should appear in `build/libs/`.

Thanks a lot! 🙏
